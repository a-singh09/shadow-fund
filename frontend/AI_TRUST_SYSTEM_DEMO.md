- Color-coded trust levels (High/Medium/Low/Unverified)
- Configurable sizes and display options
- Real-time trust score visualization

### 2. **Credibility Breakdown** (`CredibilityBreakdown.tsx`)

- Multi-factor credibility analysis
- Identity verification, organization licenses, account history
- Zero-knowledge proof integration
- Improvement suggestions for campaign creators

### 3. **Duplication Warning** (`DuplicationWarning.tsx`)

- Semantic text analysis using Google Gemini
- Multi-language duplicate detection
- Similar campaign identification with confidence scores
- Admin review workflow for flagged content

### 4. **Visual Integrity Badge** (`VisualIntegrityBadge.tsx`)

- AI-powered image verification
- Reverse image search integration
- Manipulation detection using computer vision
- IPFS storage verification
- Detailed analysis reports with metadata

### 5. **Fund Flow Visualizer** (`FundFlowDiagram.tsx`)

- Privacy-preserving impact tracking
- Sankey-style flow diagrams
- AI verification of impact claims
- Geographic and categorical impact views
- Cross-reference with trusted data sources

### 6. **AI Trust Dashboard** (`AITrustDashboard.tsx`)

- Comprehensive trust analysis interface
- Tabbed navigation for different analysis types
- Real-time AI analysis capabilities
- Integration with all trust components

## 🎨 Design System Integration

All components follow the existing ShadowFlow design system:

- **Glass morphism** styling with backdrop blur effects
- **Red accent theme** consistent with privacy branding
- **Dark mode** optimized for crypto/privacy applications
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Hover effects** and smooth transitions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### AI Integration

- **Google Gemini API** for semantic analysis and content verification
- **Computer Vision** for image authenticity detection
- **Natural Language Processing** for duplicate content detection

### Privacy Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** for identity verification
- **Encrypted Donations** using eERC20 tokens
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics** with aggregated data only
